### These are the source files for the Mailjet Java wrapper.

If you wish to compile the JAR, the most convenient way is to use Maven:

http://maven.apache.org/ (this can also be installed via Homebrew on a Mac)

Then you can run:

```shell
mvn package
```

in the <strong>mailjet-parent</strong> directory. The output will be in mailjet-wrapper-dist/target.
